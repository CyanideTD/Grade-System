This past week I worked on two JavaScript objects for the LMS login page. 
I created one that draws on the whole page and one that draws in the top 
right corner of the page. Since I needed HTML elements such as labels that
were not yet in onepagelib.js, I had to make some additions to onepage.js. This
way, I could create all of the objects using "Util" from onepagelib.js. I added
label, input, form, and maybe a couple more. I also worked a bit more with 
the Calendar group to make their page work with JavScript objects. It can 
currently draw with JavaScript objects, but the functionality is lost. We 
will continue to work in this in the upcoming weeks.
